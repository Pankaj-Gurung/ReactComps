The reason why props is used is for making the component reusable and to pass the information from one component to another.
It is like the API for the components. For eg: lets take style as a prop. We send the prop from Dropdown Component to the 
Drop Down page, lets say, we want to one style for one dropdown, one style for another dropdown, if we do not send it as a prop,
the styling for that component will be the universal, meaning the all dropdown will have same styling. When we send it as a prop
though, for the same component we can do different stylings.
